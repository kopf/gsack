You can now get your own personalised ICS calendars for rubbish collection from https://service.stuttgart.de/lhs-services/aws/abfallkalender

What follows is the original README:

# gsack

At [http://ventolin.org/code/gelber-sack](http://ventolin.org/code/gelber-sack), I provide .ics calendar files for Gelber Sack Abholtermine (dates for plastic rubbish collection) which can then be loaded into your electronic calendar of choice (iCal, Google Calendar, etc) for easy reminders. 

This repository simply contains the code that scrapes [Schaal-MÃ¼ller's website](http://www.schaal-mueller.de/GelberSackinStuttgart.aspx) and compiles the .ics files.
